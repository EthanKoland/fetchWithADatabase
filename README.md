# Overview
This is a simple project that was designed to learn how to inteact with a database using a front end express page using fetch statements.

# Learning Objectives
1. Understand how to use fetch statements to create get, post, patch, and delete requests
2. How to store data in the url to allow for dynamic pages and get requests. This is because get requests do not support body elements. So we can not send information from the front end to the back end using a json object in the get request. Instead we can store the information in the url and then use that information to make a get request to the back end.
3. Further understand how to use express to create a server and how to use the different methods that express provides to create get, post, patch, and delete requests.

# How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run devStart` to start the server
